5/1/15	Temperature and pressure dependence of methane correlations and osmotic second virial coefficients in water	The Journal of Physical Chemistry B	"We report methane’s osmotic virial coefficient over the temperatures 275 to 370 K and pressures from 1 bar up to 5000 bar evaluated using molecular simulations of a united-atom description of methane in TIP4P/2005 water. In the first half of this work, we describe an approach for calculating the water-mediated contribution to the methane–methane potential-of-mean force over all separations down to complete overlap. The enthalpic, entropic, heat capacity, volumetric, compressibility, and thermal expansivity contributions to the water-mediated interaction free energy are subsequently extracted from these simulations by fitting to a thermodynamic expansion over all the simulated state points. In the second half of this work, methane’s correlation functions are used to evaluate its osmotic second virial coefficient in the temperature–pressure plane. The virial coefficients evaluated from the McMillan–Mayer correlation function integral are shown to be in excellent agreement with those determined from the concentration dependence of methane’s excess chemical potential, providing an independent thermodynamic consistency check on the accuracy of the procedures used here. At atmospheric pressure the osmotic virial coefficient decreases with increasing temperature, indicative of increasing hydrophobic interactions. At low temperature, the virial coefficient decreases with increasing pressure while at high temperature the virial coefficient increases with increasing pressure, reflecting the underlying hyperbolic dependence of the virial coefficient on temperature and pressure. The transition between a decreasing to increasing pressure response of the osmotic virial coefficient is shown to follow the response of the methane–methane contact peak to changes in pressure as a function of temperature, though a universal correlation is not observed."

6/9/14	Direct evaluation of polypeptide partial molar volumes in water using molecular dynamics simulations	Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data	"Molecular simulations of a series of tri- and tetrapeptides with the sequences Gly-X-Gly and Gly-X-Y-Gly, where X and Y are neutral amino acid side chains, have been performed to characterize their volumetric properties in water at 300 K. The chains were terminated with both zwitterionic and neutral N-acetyl/amide functionalities to examine end group effects. The simulations accurately capture the experimental effects of side chain mutations and increasing peptide length, suggesting simulations can provide insight into the properties of unfolded oligopeptides and proteins. For the zwitterionic terminated chains, however, simulations exhibit a constant, lower volume than the experiment, suggesting that simulations over-predict electrostriction by the charged end groups. The simulation volumes are well-described by a group additivity based correlation, yielding excellent agreement between simulated side chain group volumes and the experiment. The accuracy of our simulations and fidelity of the group additivity model to reproduce simulation volumes suggest that it is possible to screen the potential effects of side chain interactions on group volumes especially when they are charged with longer ranged interactions."

12/5/08	Numerical validation of ift in the analysis of protein–surfactant complexes with saxs and sans	Langmuir	"The use of the indirect Fourier transform methods for evaluating structural parameters directly in real space with small-angle scattering measurements is validated for the analysis of protein-surfactant complexes. An efficient Monte Carlo approach rapidly generates in silico structures based on a realistic pearl-necklace model for denatured proteins decorated with surfactant micelles. Corresponding scattering profiles are calculated and averaged over a large number of possible configurations for each structure. IFT algorithms are then used to calculate the corresponding pair-distance distribution function, and structural information is extracted directly without model fitting. The extracted parameters are compared and correlated with the known structure of the simulated complexes to assess the quality of the information that can be reliably obtained from these systems. The average extension, nearest-neighbor micelle distance, and average number of associated micelles are all accurately extracted through IFT calculations. Improved and simple approaches to reliably extract the average extension of the complex and the total number of associated micelles are presented."	"Franklin, J. M.; Surampudi, L. N.; Ashbaugh, H.

11/3/08	Optimization of linear and branched alkane interactions with water to simulate hydrophobic hydration	The Journal of Chemical Physics	"Previous studies of simple gas hydration have demonstrated that the accuracy of molecular simulations at capturing the thermodynamic signatures of hydrophobic hydration is linked both to the fidelity of the water model at replicating the experimental liquid density at ambient pressure and an accounting of polarization interactions between the solute and water. We extend those studies to examine alkane hydration using the transferable potentials for phase equilibria united-atom model for linear and branched alkanes, developed to reproduce alkane phase behavior, and the TIP4P/2005 model for water, which provides one of the best descriptions of liquid water for the available fixed-point charge models. Alkane site/water oxygen Lennard-Jones cross interactionswere optimized to reproduce the experimental alkane hydration free energies over a range of temperatures. The optimized model reproduces the hydration free energies of the fitted alkanes with a root mean square difference between simulation and experiment of 0.06 kcal/mol over a wide temperature range, compared to 0.44 kcal/mol for the parent model. The optimized model accurately reproduces the temperature dependence of hydrophobic hydration, as characterized by the hydration enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities, as well as the pressure response, as characterized by partial molar volumes."

7/15/05	The determining role of scratch indenter radius on surface deformation of high density polyethylene and calcium carbonate-reinforced composite	Materials Science and Engineering: A 	"We have used microscopy techniques to examine mechanically induced surface damage during microscratching of high density polyethylene and calcium carbonate-reinforced composite. The radius of stylus has a dominant effect on surface deformation, which can be predicted from the characteristics of surface morphologyand the scratch deformation parameters. However, the resistance to scratch deformation is not linearly related to radius but depends on the geometry of the stylus. The surface deformation behavior is discussed in terms of physical (crystallinity, spherulite size) and mechanical properties (elastic modulus, elastic recovery, toughness, and scratch hardness)."

7/15/05	On scratch deformation of glass fiber reinforced nylon 66	Materials Science and Engineering: A	"The scratch deformation of glass fiber reinforced nylon 66 exhibits a striking dependence on applied load. The scratch morphology at lower loads is characterized by plastic flow that involves voiding and fibrillation that transforms at higher loads into brittle fracture of glass fibers and detachment from the matrix. Voids, fibrillation, and mechanically induced surface roughness are source of light scattering that consequently produce stress-whitened surface. The degree of scratch damage is directly related to scratch hardness."	"Surampudi, N. L.; Ramisetti, N. K.; Misra, R. D.
