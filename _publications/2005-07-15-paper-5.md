collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2005-07-15-paper-5
excerpt: 'We have usedÊmicroscopy techniquesÊto examine mechanically inducedÊsurface damageÊduring microscratching of high densityÊpolyethyleneÊand calcium carbonate-reinforced composite. The radius of stylus has a dominant effect on surface deformation, which can be predicted from the characteristics ofÊsurface morphologyand the scratch deformation parameters. However, the resistance to scratch deformation is not linearly related to radius but depends on the geometry of the stylus. The surface deformation behavior is discussed in terms of physical (crystallinity, spherulite size) and mechanical properties (elastic modulus, elastic recovery, toughness, and scratch hardness).'
