collection: publications
permalink: /publication/8/3/11-paper-4
excerpt: 'Previous studies of simple gas hydration have demonstrated that the accuracy of molecular simulations at capturing the thermodynamic signatures ofÊhydrophobicÊhydration is linked both to the fidelity of theÊwaterÊmodel at replicating the experimental liquid density at ambient pressure and an accounting of polarizationÊinteractionsÊbetween the solute andÊwater.ÊWe extend those studies to examine alkane hydration using the transferable potentials for phase equilibria united-atom model for linear and branched alkanes, developed to reproduce alkane phase behavior, and the TIP4P/2005 model forÊwater,Êwhich provides one of the best descriptions of liquidÊwaterÊfor the available fixed-point charge models. Alkane site/water oxygen Lennard-Jones crossÊinteractionswere optimized to reproduce the experimental alkane hydrationÊfree energiesÊover a range of temperatures. The optimized model reproduces the hydrationÊfree energiesÊof the fitted alkanes with a root mean square difference between simulation andÊexperimentÊof 0.06 kcal/mol over a wide temperature range, compared to 0.44 kcal/mol for the parent model. The optimized model accurately reproduces the temperature dependence ofÊhydrophobicÊhydration, as characterized by the hydrationÊenthalpies,Êentropies,ÊandÊheat capacities,Êas well as the pressure response, as characterized by partial molar volumes.'
